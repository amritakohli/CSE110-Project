The scientific training involved in pharmacy education may stem from a humanist/agnostic philosophy. Therefore, regular meetings of Christians can help students maintain perspective on the “big picture” God has planned for mankind as He revealed in the Bible. \r\r2.\tBible Study/Discussion/Prayer \rThe need to examine, study, and struggle with social/medical issues has never been greater. Faith rooted in Scripture builds firm convictions about God, man, lifestyle, human relationships, purpose of science, and the nature of a profession. Christian principles taught through the Bible equip pharmacy students to become compassionate pharmacists that go above and beyond to care for the entire patient by meeting their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Times of discussion encourage growth of the chapter through shared experiences and individual insights. Prayer helps the chapter to remain dependent on God. \r\r3.\tMinistry Projects \rA young attorney once asked Jesus a test question in an attempt to entrap him. “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus responded with a question of his own. “You know the Law. How do you read it? Sum it up in one sentence.” The young attorney quickly answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” (Luke 10:25-29 and Mark 10:17) Jesus complimented the attorney on his succinct answer and told him to do just as he had answered. \rOne of the characteristics of our society today is the rapid decline of a sense of community in tandem with an epidemic of autonomy. One does not have to travel far to do mission work; many opportunities are available in every community. Wherever God has placed you is your mission field and even closer to “home” are those who sit next to you in class every day. Remember that we are told to start at home (Jerusalem), then work with interfacing cultures (Judea and Samaria), and then distant cultures (ends of the earth). \r\r4.\tWitness \r“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” \rActs 1:8 \rEvery one of us is a witness for Jesus Christ. The question is, “Are we effective?” Student chapters should consider evangelism as individuals and as a chapter. The chapter should be a source of strength and encouragement for personal outreach. \rThere is another facet to our Christian witness: The individual who sees himself/herself called by God and who knows Jesus Christ as the Lord of all creation is vitally concerned about this world and its values and priorities. Our witness involves not only a verbal declaration of the saving power of Jesus Christ, but a promotion of Christian alternatives to secularism and other “isms” which are dehumanizing and degrading to man. The Christian view of life has more than a passing relevance to a discipline concerned with life, death, and the person. A chapter genuinely concerned with its witness must seek to let its light radiate forth in the midst of the healthcare community, piercing every facet. \r\r5.\tWorship \r“Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name. For the LORD is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.” \rPsalm 100 \rThough worship may not be the primary goal of our student chapter, it will be difficult to meet regularly as Christians and not spend some time worshiping our Heavenly Father. Worship will often unify a student chapter as no other activity can, and it is greatly encouraged where ever Christians gather.",

Through tranquil meditations and an emphasis on the elevation of one’s heart-mind character, Falun Dafa has brought health and well-being to more than 100 million people in 100 countries around the world. Falun Dafa is not a religion, there is no membership and is completely free of charge! It is a mind-body practice with a spiritual component that covers metaphysics, ethics and enlightenment. Through persistent practice one strives to achieve a state of selflessness, increased insight, inner purity, balance- true health and ultimately enlightenment. Since July 1999 the communist government of China has persecuted and enslaved millions of innocent people for practicing Falun Dafa and they comprise 65% of labor camps, detention centers and prisons across China for believing in Truth- Compassion- Forbearance. Evidence from acclaimed sources have proven tens of thousands of Falun Dafa practitioners to have been killed from live organ harvesting for China’s lucrative organ transplant market. So what do we, as an organization, do on campus? We meditate together and teach the exercises, promote cultural art events that revive traditional Chinese culture and raise awareness about the persecution and organ harvesting of Falun Dafa practitioners in China.",

Our primary goals is to qualify for Intercollegiate Nationals hosted at the end of each season. Each skater performs individually in events of their choosing (in their corresponding level). The points they earn from podium placement get added to the UCSD cumulative team score which goes towards rankings. The top four teams per section are invited to Nationals at the end of the season, and we have qualified the last 3 years in a row! Intercollegiate competitions are a great place to have fun and bond as a team as well as getting to network with like-minded skaters and students from all over the nation. \r\rCompeting, while fun, is not a requirement. Our team is also open to anyone who loves figure skating! We host different social events throughout the year for skating enthusiasts and skaters alike - watch parties, skating night, and of course dessert trips. With many of our members being long time skaters and some even being professional coaches, it's a great networking opportunity for people who have never skated before but would love to give it a try! \r\rOur team is tight knit on and off the ice. Practices are largely self scheduled as figure skating is a sport driven by individual motivation to improve. However, members often carpool to practice help one another with jumps, spins, and choreography. Figure Skating at UCSD is open to anyone who loves the ice, and whether you've been competing your whole life or you've never put on a pair of skates before, this team has a place for you.",
